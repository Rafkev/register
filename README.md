# register
Registration form created using HTML with external CSS
The HTML file (registration_form.html) contains the structure of the registration form, including input fields for name, email, password, and confirm password, along with a submit button.
The CSS file (styles.css) contains the styles for the registration form, such as form layout, input field styles, button styles, etc.
You can further customize the styles and structure of the registration form to match your requirements. When using this form in a real-world application, you may want to add client-side and server-side validation to ensure the data entered by users is valid and secure.
